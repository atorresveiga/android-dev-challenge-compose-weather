![Workflow result](https://github.com/atorresveiga/android-dev-challenge-compose-weather/workflows/Check/badge.svg)

Blue Cloud is another weather app that attempts to use the latest cutting edge libraries and tools. As a summary:
*Entirely written in Kotlin.
*UI completely written in Jetpack Compose (see below).
*Uses Kotlin Coroutines throughout.
*Uses many of the Architecture Components, including: Room, WorkManager, Navigation.
*Uses Hilt for dependency injection

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
This project started as an Android Dev Challenge that I had not the time to finish. The idea, animations and the and all the crazy things I wanted to try with Jetpack Compose stayed spinning in my head though. Therefore, I decided to keep working on it and also use it to try many other interesting libraries that I had no chance yet to use in a real project.
